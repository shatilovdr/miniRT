# MiniRT

## ðŸª§ Overview
### Description
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.
Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you
will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.
Our first raytracer handle the followings:
* Ambient, diffuse and specular lightning (phong effect)
* Multiple lights colors and intensity
* The followings primitive objects : Planes, Spheres, Cylinders and Cones
* Texture map and bump map

### Goal
The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.
